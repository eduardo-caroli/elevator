# Elevator
This is an elevator system simulation developed using Lua and the LÃ–VE2D framework. The simulation offers 2 modes: One is a simulation, properly speaking. The second mode is a minigame, in which a player is the engineer and must fix the elevator.

## The Simulation
The simulation consists of one elevator in a 6 story building. It has 3 initializing options:
1. The elevator goes from the first to the sixth floor
2. The elevator receives orders via keyboard
3. The elevator uses a pre-existing list of orders from a .csv file
